/*___________________Paradigm___________________

    An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style
    and technique.

    Types:

    1- Procedural Programming
    2- Object Oriented Programmming
    3- Functional Programming

/*

    First-class Function => function are treated as varibles, we can pass them into
                            other funtion, and return them from function.
    
    Dynamic => Type of variable can easily be changed.

/*  
    Statement => A bigger piece of code does not produces a value on itself.

  const a = "15 is greater than 10";

/*______________Falsy Value_________________

    When we convert these values to boolean gives false.

    1- 0  (zero)
    2- "" (empty sting)
    3- undefined 
    4- Null
    5- NaN (Not a Number)

/*_____________Equality Operator_____________

    1- == : It is used to check if two values are equal or 
            not. It performs Type Coersion.
          
    2- === : Strict equality operator, checks 2 values are
             equal or not, it does not perform Type Coersion.

    3- != : Loose inequality, performs Type Coersion.

    4- !== : Strict inequality, does not perform Type Coersion.
